# Sisyphos -- Multiple Choice Entering Tool
A simple command-line based alternative to enter given answers to
multiple choice questions. Sisyphos conforms to the format of the
Aarhus [Multiple Choice Tool](http://www.brics.dk/Multiple/) and
thus can be used as an alternative to their GUI based tool.
